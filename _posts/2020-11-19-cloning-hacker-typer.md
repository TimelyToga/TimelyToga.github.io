I created a clone of the [HackerTyper](http://hackertyper.com/) project in 2015 and wrote a little blog post about it on [Medium](https://medium.com/@Tim_Blumberg/how-to-clone-hackertyper-db0a472212f6).

It's a fun little website where you can just type like crazy and it shows a bunch of crazy text like you are hacking into the mainframe. I upgraded the original by generating random code instead of just printing and reprinting the same thing everytime.

I just ported it over to my website so you can [find it here](/hacker_typer).
