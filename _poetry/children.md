Old men  
They have had  
their chance  
to make the   
best of what   
was handed  
to them.   
  
If an old man  
is a failure,   
there is little  
question as  
to whom  
could possibly  
be to blame.  
  
There is justice  
in that they have  
had their go  
at a great   
many number  
of gambles  
to prove their  
worth  
and earn  
their keep.  
  
Children,  
on the other hand,  
have only what  
has been given  
to them.   
  
The universe only  
exists as far  
as their elders  
have seen fit to   
illuminate for them.   
  
They have had no  
chance to sift   
through the  
chaff and bullshit  
to find their   
truth.   
To prove their worth.   
  
Their worth is   
in their potential,   
but potential can’t   
buy groceries  
or pay rent  
or tuition.   
  
Potential is innocuous.   
Potential feels imaginary  
because you often  
can’t see it until   
it has come to fruition.  
  
Children do not   
get to decide  
their parents'  
income  
or social   
status  
or geographic  
location.   
  
They are forced  
to slowly learn  
that the way that  
the conditions that  
shaped  
them  
in their most   
impressionable  
years  
are entirely   
without relation  
to their choices.  
  
We cannot alter  
the way   
things are  
  
We can   
only strive to displace  
the hardship that some  
have been offered  
in the stead of luck.
