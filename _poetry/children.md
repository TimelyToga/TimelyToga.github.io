Old men<br>
They have had<br>
their chance<br>
to make the <br>
best of what <br>
was handed<br>
to them. <br>
<br>
If an old man<br>
is a failure, <br>
there is little<br>
question as<br>
to whom<br>
could possibly<br>
be to blame.<br>
<br>
There is justice<br>
in that they have<br>
had their go<br>
at a great <br>
many number<br>
of gambles<br>
to prove their<br>
worth<br>
and earn<br>
their keep.<br>
<br>
Children,<br>
on the other hand,<br>
have only what<br>
has been given<br>
to them. <br>
<br>
The universe only<br>
exists as far<br>
as their elders<br>
have seen fit to <br>
illuminate for them. <br>
<br>
They have had no<br>
chance to sift <br>
through the<br>
chaff and bullshit<br>
to find their <br>
truth. <br>
To prove their worth. <br>
<br>
Their worth is <br>
in their potential, <br>
but potential can’t <br>
buy groceries<br>
or pay rent<br>
or tuition. <br>
<br>
Potential is innocuous. <br>
Potential feels imaginary<br>
because you often<br>
can’t see it until <br>
it has come to fruition.<br>
<br>
Children do not <br>
get to decide<br>
their parents'<br>
income<br>
or social <br>
status<br>
or geographic<br>
location. <br>
<br>
They are forced<br>
to slowly learn<br>
that the way that<br>
the conditions that<br>
shaped<br>
them<br>
in their most <br>
impressionable<br>
years<br>
are entirely <br>
without relation<br>
to their choices.<br>
<br>
We cannot alter<br>
the way <br>
things are<br>
<br>
We can <br>
only strive to displace<br>
the hardship that some<br>
have been offered<br>
in the stead of luck.
