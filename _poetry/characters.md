description: Reading Chinese feels quite different than reading anything else

Navigating  
the forrest  
of strokes  
inspires  
chagrin  
at my  
lackluster  
vocabulary  
  
I stalk  
my targets  
with hushed   
breath  
and darting  
eyes  
  
I meander   
past alien   
monuments  
to concepts  
I cannot  
fathom  
  
their   
meaning  
their   
history  
is  
unknowable  
to me  
  
When I  
find you   
buried   
in that list  
it is   
because   
you are   
your characters  
to me  
  
I know   
their meaning  
  
I invented  
their meaning  
  
They feel   
like you  
  
their meaning   
is every   
minute   
I spent  
with you  
  
their meaning  
is everything   
I ever   
told you  
  
their meaning  
is the   
silence   
following   
the roar   
in my heart  
  
I love  
those characters  
as I love you
