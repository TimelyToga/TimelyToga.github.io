Navigating<br/>
the forrest<br/>
of strokes<br/>
inspires<br/>
chagrin<br/>
at my<br/>
lackluster<br/>
vocabulary<br/>
<br/>
I stalk<br/>
my targets<br/>
with hushed <br/>
breath<br/>
and darting<br/>
eyes<br/>
<br/>
I meander <br/>
past alien <br/>
monuments<br/>
to concepts<br/>
I cannot<br/>
fathom<br/>
<br/>
their <br/>
meaning<br/>
their <br/>
history<br/>
is<br/>
unknowable<br/>
to me<br/>
<br/>
When I<br/>
find you <br/>
buried <br/>
in that list<br/>
it is <br/>
because <br/>
you are <br/>
your characters<br/>
to me<br/>
<br/>
I know <br/>
their meaning<br/>
<br/>
I invented<br/>
their meaning<br/>
<br/>
They feel <br/>
like you<br/>
<br/>
their meaning <br/>
is every <br/>
minute <br/>
I spent<br/>
with you<br/>
<br/>
their meaning<br/>
is everything <br/>
I ever <br/>
told you<br/>
<br/>
their meaning<br/>
is the <br/>
silence <br/>
following <br/>
the roar <br/>
in my heart<br/>
<br/>
I love those characters<br/>
as I love you<br/>
