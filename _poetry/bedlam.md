The room was   
bedlam:  
strident conversations  
drowned out by   
deafening music  
fueled by  
pungent libations  
all exacerbated  
by the bodies  
of hundreds.  
  
They huddled   
in the   
quietest of corners,  
giggling  
and   
unaware   
of the   
obscenities   
of the scene around  
them.  
  
Shared imaginings  
of a better   
world   
poked through  
their protective  
shells,  
daring them   
to reveal  
to share  
their dreams  
ambitions  
desires  
hopes  
fears   
Beliefs  
  
At every turn  
of phrase  
he half-expected   
for his   
long expected  
long overdue   
reckoning to   
Manifest  
  
For her to   
reveal   
lurking   
insanity,  
incipient  
psychosis,  
Or even   
crippling   
Narcissism  
   
To his  
ultimate  
delight,  
He was rather   
met with a   
rapidly  
accelerating  
force of attraction.  
His world   
shifting   
blue  
as he blinked   
through infatuation,  
hurtled past   
romantic interest,  
careening   
wholly into  
the vibrant,  
explosive,  
pardonless,  
commitment   
of love  
  
The paroxysms   
of daily life   
were dulled into   
intransitivity   
by the   
breathless  
whispers  
she ladled   
ever so   
gently   
into his ears.  
  
His nights  
became  
hers  
as they  
endeavored   
to include  
each other   
in an   
poignantly   
ephemeral   
vision of the  
what was  
to come.  
  
There they  
huddled—  
at the   
violent  
nucleus   
of unfettered  
love;  
bravely staring   
into the   
vacuum of   
experience  
lying in their   
collective future,  
goading   
the universe   
to rend  
their hearts  
asunder  
with provocations  
of romantic  
attachment.
