title: The Happy Sun
date: Dec 17th, 2014
description: I was raised in a deeply Christian environment. This poem attempts to capture that feeling of awe and later the dissonance as the immaculate truth I held started to crumble.

The happy sun<br>
rises over<br>
the horizon. <br>
Its happy rays <br>
spread happiness<br>
through all the land.<br>
Without the<br>
happy sun<br>
spreading it<br>
happy rays<br>
throughout all the land,<br>
all the land cannot<br>
feel happiness. <br>
<br>
You know this<br>
because<br>
your mother<br>
told you so. <br>
What better reason<br>
could you ask for?<br>
As far as you<br>
can tell, <br>
your mother<br>
knows everything<br>
and has no faults.<br>
<br>
So you believe <br>
that the happy sun<br>
is the source of all<br>
happiness.<br>
For as long as <br>
you can remember,<br>
everyone that you have<br>
ever met has also <br>
believed that the happy<br>
sun spreading its happy rays<br>
is the only way for all<br>
the lands to feel <br>
happiness. <br>
<br>
Your mother tells<br>
you that some people <br>
don’t believe that the<br>
happy sun is<br>
the source <br>
of all happiness. <br>
<br>
This confuses you,<br>
because the <br>
happy sun is<br>
so very clearly <br>
the source of <br>
all happiness. <br>
<br>
The happy sun<br>
rises every day <br>
and makes all<br>
the lands happy. <br>
That is the cycle.<br>
You know it by heart.<br>
<br>
So the people<br>
who don’t believe<br>
that the happy sun<br>
is the source of all <br>
happiness, they<br>
can’t be happy. <br>
<br>
Since you<br>
like being happy,<br>
it makes sense that<br>
you should tell<br>
them that the <br>
happy sun <br>
really is the source<br>
of all happiness.<br>
<br>
So you do.<br>
<br>
But as you tell<br>
them that the<br>
reason that they<br>
aren’t happy is that<br>
they don’t believe<br>
the happy sun<br>
is the source of<br>
all happiness,<br>
you notice that<br>
they do look<br>
pretty happy. <br>
<br>
That’s odd.<br>
<br>
You think that<br>
you had better<br>
ask your mother<br>
why this is.<br>
<br>
So you do.<br>
<br>
Your mother says<br>
that you are wrong<br>
and you couldn’t have<br>
possibly seen<br>
what you think<br>
you’ve seen,<br>
So you should <br>
stop talking about<br>
things that you <br>
don’t understand<br>
and just have faith.<br>
Faith that the happy sun<br>
is the<br>
source of all happiness.<br>
<br>
Over time you <br>
find more and more<br>
things that seem to <br>
be at odds with the<br>
stories that your mother<br>
has told you,<br>
<br>
The happy sun<br>
was never real.<br>
But somehow <br>
his memory lives<br>
on.
