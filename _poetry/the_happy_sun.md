title: The Happy Sun
date: Dec 17th, 2014
description: I was raised in a deeply Christian environment. This poem attempts to capture that feeling of awe and later the dissonance as the immaculate truth I held started to crumble.

The happy sun  
rises over  
the horizon.   
Its happy rays   
spread happiness  
through all the land.  
Without the  
happy sun  
spreading it  
happy rays  
throughout all the land,  
all the land cannot  
feel happiness.   
  
You know this  
because  
your mother  
told you so.   
What better reason  
could you ask for?  
As far as you  
can tell,   
your mother  
knows everything  
and has no faults.  
  
So you believe   
that the happy sun  
is the source of all  
happiness.  
For as long as   
you can remember,  
everyone that you have  
ever met has also   
believed that the happy  
sun spreading its happy rays  
is the only way for all  
the lands to feel   
happiness.   
  
Your mother tells  
you that some people   
don’t believe that the  
happy sun is  
the source   
of all happiness.   
  
This confuses you,  
because the   
happy sun is  
so very clearly   
the source of   
all happiness.   
  
The happy sun  
rises every day   
and makes all  
the lands happy.   
That is the cycle.  
You know it by heart.  
  
So the people  
who don’t believe  
that the happy sun  
is the source of all   
happiness, they  
can’t be happy.   
  
Since you  
like being happy,  
it makes sense that  
you should tell  
them that the   
happy sun   
really is the source  
of all happiness.  
  
So you do.  
  
But as you tell  
them that the  
reason that they  
aren’t happy is that  
they don’t believe  
the happy sun  
is the source of  
all happiness,  
you notice that  
they do look  
pretty happy.   
  
That’s odd.  
  
You think that  
you had better  
ask your mother  
why this is.  
  
So you do.  
  
Your mother says  
that you are wrong  
and you couldn’t have  
possibly seen  
what you think  
you’ve seen,  
So you should   
stop talking about  
things that you   
don’t understand  
and just have faith.  
Faith that the happy sun  
is the  
source of all happiness.  
  
Over time you   
find more and more  
things that seem to   
be at odds with the  
stories that your mother  
has told you,  
  
The happy sun  
was never real.  
But somehow   
his memory lives  
on.
