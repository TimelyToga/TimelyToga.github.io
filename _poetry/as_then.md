description: I find myself feeling the need to defend the drama of this poem. But I think it's poignant in it's naivity.

She’s right here   
I feel her   
as I felt her then.   
  
My heart   
my skin  
my face   
feel her   
  
And yet,   
I see her   
standing on   
the far edge of   
a canyon  
In its volume  
a fierce storm   
is fomenting   
  
Over the thunder  
I hear her breath   
Despite the wind  
I smell her hair   
Regardless of the distance  
I feel her hand in mine  
  
Her silhouette  
painting the sky is  
overshadowed   
by a setting sun   
  
I see her   
hair whipping  
her face an infinite   
distance away  
   
 And moment by moment  
 she travels farther   
 she’s harder to make out  
   
But she’s right here   
I feel her   
as I felt her then.   
  
 the moments of  
 togetherness   
 were sweet   
 and will fade gently  
 from body   
 from mind  
 from me
