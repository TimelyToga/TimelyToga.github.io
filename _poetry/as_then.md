description: I find myself feeling the need to defend the drama of this poem. But I think it's poignant in it's naivity.

She’s right here <br>
I feel her <br>
as I felt her then. <br>
<br>
My heart <br>
my skin<br>
my face <br>
feel her <br>
<br>
And yet, <br>
I see her <br>
standing on <br>
the far edge of <br>
a canyon<br>
In its volume<br>
a fierce storm <br>
is fomenting <br>
<br>
Over the thunder<br>
I hear her breath <br>
Despite the wind<br>
I smell her hair <br>
Regardless of the distance<br>
I feel her hand in mine<br>
<br>
Her silhouette<br>
painting the sky is<br>
overshadowed <br>
by a setting sun <br>
<br>
I see her <br>
hair whipping<br>
her face an infinite <br>
distance away<br>
 <br>
 And moment by moment<br>
 she travels farther <br>
 she’s harder to make out<br>
 <br>
But she’s right here <br>
I feel her <br>
as I felt her then. <br>
<br>
 the moments of<br>
 togetherness <br>
 were sweet <br>
 and will fade gently<br>
 from body <br>
 from mind<br>
 from me<br>
