title: We are the same creatures
date: April 2nd, 2018
description: I often find myself deeply proud of the amazing things that humanity is able to accomplish. We are incessantly inventive and are forever striving to create new thingsâ€”and yet, we have also committed terrible crimes against each other.

We are the <br>
same creatures <br>
that sealed <br>
men in <br>
metal cans <br>
atop of <br>
chemical bombs<br>
and hung<br>
them above <br>
our atmosphere<br>
so they could <br>
show us <br>
what they saw<br>
<br>
We are the<br>
same creatures <br>
that <br>
cornered <br>
wild horses <br>
on the<br>
desolate<br>
plains of<br>
pre-history <br>
so we <br>
could unite <br>
ourselves<br>
with the <br>
destinations <br>
at the end <br>
of vast distances<br>
<br>
We are the <br>
same creatures <br>
that pulled<br>
back the <br>
curtain on <br>
the dynamics <br>
of the <br>
natural world <br>
<br>
We are the<br>
same creatures <br>
that built <br>
entire societies <br>
upon the <br>
understanding <br>
that because <br>
our high technology<br>
allows us <br>
to walk onto <br>
distant beaches <br>
and leave<br>
the owner <br>
of equals <br>
believed <br>
to be<br>
animals.<br>
<br>
We are the<br>
same creatures <br>
that unleashed<br>
balls of <br>
fire and flame <br>
large enough <br>
to <br>
erase cities <br>
from reality <br>
all over <br>
lines on  <br>
maps<br>
<br>
Our<br>
civilizations <br>
have risen and <br>
fallen with <br>
a comedic <br>
periodicity <br>
as we <br>
strive<br>
to define <br>
the act of <br>
being human.<br>
<br>
Our history<br>
is ferociously <br>
upsetting. <br>
We have <br>
committed acts<br>
too heinous <br>
to fathom <br>
given our <br>
current <br>
paved roads,<br>
movie theatres,<br>
and puppy stores. <br>
<br>
Dare not remove <br>
yourself from <br>
this "We"<br>
as <br>
Countless times <br>
we have proved <br>
to ourselves <br>
that our savagery<br>
is infinite <br>
in its ingenuity<br>
and it can <br>
take as little <br>
as 6 days <br>
for anyone<br>
to transform <br>
into Cruelty<br>
herself. <br>
<br>
We are<br>
a young<br>
species<br>
with many <br>
mistakes yet <br>
to make,<br>
but I am <br>
proud to be <br>
alive and to <br>
know that <br>
<br>
I <br>
am human<br>
<br>
You<br>
are human <br>
<br>
The progress <br>
we have made <br>
points me <br>
only to <br>
the glory <br>
we can <br>
achieve <br>
beyond the present. <br>
<br>
Gather close <br>
with a stranger now <br>
and rejoice<br>
<br>
in all that<br>
we <br>
are in common<br>
and are different<br>
<br>
in all that<br>
we<br>
have overcome <br>
and all the <br>
higher we <br>
will streak<br>
upwards.
