title: We are the same creatures
date: April 2nd, 2018
description: I often find myself deeply proud of the amazing things that humanity is able to accomplish. We are incessantly inventive and are forever striving to create new thingsâ€”and yet, we have also committed terrible crimes against each other.

We are the   
same creatures   
that sealed   
men in   
metal cans   
atop of   
chemical bombs  
and hung  
them above   
our atmosphere  
so they could   
show us   
what they saw  
  
We are the  
same creatures   
that   
cornered   
wild horses   
on the  
desolate  
plains of  
pre-history   
so we   
could unite   
ourselves  
with the   
destinations   
at the end   
of vast distances  
  
We are the   
same creatures   
that pulled  
back the   
curtain on   
the dynamics   
of the   
natural world   
  
We are the  
same creatures   
that built   
entire societies   
upon the   
understanding   
that because   
our high technology  
allows us   
to walk onto   
distant beaches   
and leave  
the owner   
of equals   
believed   
to be  
animals.  
  
We are the  
same creatures   
that unleashed  
balls of   
fire and flame   
large enough   
to   
erase cities   
from reality   
all over   
lines on    
maps  
  
Our  
civilizations   
have risen and   
fallen with   
a comedic   
periodicity   
as we   
strive  
to define   
the act of   
being human.  
  
Our history  
is ferociously   
upsetting.   
We have   
committed acts  
too heinous   
to fathom   
given our   
current   
paved roads,  
movie theatres,  
and puppy stores.   
  
Dare not remove   
yourself from   
this "We"  
as   
Countless times   
we have proved   
to ourselves   
that our savagery  
is infinite   
in its ingenuity  
and it can   
take as little   
as 6 days   
for anyone  
to transform   
into Cruelty  
herself.   
  
We are  
a young  
species  
with many   
mistakes yet   
to make,  
but I am   
proud to be   
alive and to   
know that   
  
I   
am human  
  
You  
are human   
  
The progress   
we have made   
points me   
only to   
the glory   
we can   
achieve   
beyond the present.   
  
Gather close   
with a stranger now   
and rejoice  
  
in all that  
we   
are in common  
and are different  
  
in all that  
we  
have overcome   
and all the   
higher we   
will streak  
upwards.
