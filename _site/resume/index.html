                <p>CNSPEC is a company working on some really interesting space-oriented applications for superhighrises in China. We build sophisticated 3D model of the building with BIM data, engineering plans, 3D scans, faculty and staff etc, and then build business applications utilizing these models. The applications we build leverage some really fascinating technology and I've had a blast learning something new every day.</p>
                
                <p>My responsibilities at CNSPEC have involved a huge scope. I have been requirde to learn a lot of new skills and harden their system architecture. I have written a lot of 2D and 3D map frontend interfaces for their client buildings (including Shanghai Tower, the tallest building in China at 128 floors). I have built and managed webservers, optimized DB performance, upgraded API endpoints to HTTPS, and a lot more. Most of our work is in private cloud deployments, so I don't have many links to share. :(</p>

                <h4>Duke; Jan - May 2017</h4>
                
                <p>The impetus for this project was while I had been programming for a considerable amount of time, all of my code was written to run on the CPU. I didn't really understand how computer graphics worked and how code written for a GPU was designed or written. So I decided to learn C++ and computer graphics at the same time! I self-studied C++, OpenGL, general computer graphics theory, and then moved on to Physically Based Rendering (PBR).</p>
                
                <p>After several months of independent studying, I used an open-ended mathematics final project as an opportunity to dig a little deeper on the mathematically theory behind 3D computer graphics as well as modern Disney Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) PBR methods. My final paper and presentation are linked below.</p>
                
                <p>This project was easily one of the coolest arcs af exploring and learning that I've ever experienced because it:</p>
                
                <p><ul>
    <li>Demystified the GPU and the programs that run on it</li>
    <li>Consolidated my aqueous understanding of Linear Algebra and visually demonstrated the sheer power 
        of making use of the proper mathematical machinery. 
    </li>
    <li>Making realistic lighting simulations that run at flawlessly at 60 FPS is fucking FUN</li>
</ul>

            <h2>Using IBM Watson to Discern How My Personality Evolved</h2>
            <div class="timeline_entry_description">
                <h4>Duke; December, 2014</h4>
                
                <p>I recently found a demo of IBM Watson's User Modeling and decided to see if I could harness this tech demo to analyze my own personality. I have kept a digital journal since 2011, so I had a large amount of data available to analyze, so I extracted the text of journal entries by year and submitted them to the analytical eye of Watson. I wrote a pretty detailed blog post about my process and results. Most interestingly, I found that as I developed into an adult, I didn't develop new characteristics really. But rather, I pruned out certain characteristics and marginally advanced others. So my strongest traits became stronger and I completely deleted certain other traits out of my personality all together. Overall this was one of the most informative technical investigations I have ever done because it taught me a lot about myself.</p>

                <h4>HackDuke; Fall 2014</h4>
                
                <p>WikiQuiz was my entry into <a href="http://www.hackduke.com/">HackDuke's</a> 2014 Education category. WikiQuiz is the embodiment of a very long running project of mine to figure out how to extract the most salient objective facts from a corpus of text. In this case I do so by a combination of a number of methods chief of which is some basic NLP feature extraction using nltk. I believe that if the process of extracting the important and objective thoughts from a body of text is one of greatest challenges that technology is facing today. I began development at HackDuke and have since been making modifications to better the question generation.</p>

                <p>LearnThings is a studying app built for procrastinators. Instead of cramming for a single continuous chunk of time before an exam, one could use LearnThings to space that studying time out over several weeks. LearnThings uses notifications to passively ask you questions, which you can directly interact with, or tap through to grade yourself. LearnThings is at most two taps per interaction, so the experience is left light. You can tell LearnThings when you are available so that you will only get asked questions within that time frame.</p>
