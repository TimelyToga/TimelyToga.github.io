    <p>I am fascinated with the written word for communicating a precise emotion. From time to time, 
I like to try and capture a snapshot of a powerful emotion that I have felt. I think frequently 
poems are written that intensionally arcane and confusing but nonetheless the author spirits you 
to a particular state of mind.</p>

<p>My favorite poets are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/pablo-neruda">Pablo Neruda</a>
    <ul>
      <li>My favorite: <a href="https://allpoetry.com/Tonight-I-Can-Write-(The-Saddest-Lines)">Tonight I Can Write (The saddest lines)</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddw1_3ZVjTE">Billy Collins</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-ernest-henley">William Earnest Henley</a>
    <ul>
      <li>My favorite: <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus">Invictus</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Carl Sagan
    <ul>
      <li>My favorite: <a href="https://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/earth/pale-blue-dot.html">A Pale Blue Dot</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>William Wordsworth
    <ul>

<p>In college, I got the idea that it would be fun to learn how to use Adobe Illustrator, so I made <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/19454861/Wallpapers">a desktop wallpaper every week</a> 
that featured poetry quotes.</p>

<h2 id="my-poems">My Poems</h2>

<h3>
    <a href="/poetry/children.html">
    Children
    - 2013.12.18
    </a>
</h3>
<p>This poem recounts a bit of the helplessness I felt as a child and the resolution to do my best to make the best of infinitely lucky position that I have found myself in.</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/poetry/why_did_this_happen.html">
    Why Did This Happen?
    - 2014.09.24
    </a>
</h3>
<p>At the beginning of my sophomore year of college, I lost a dear friend to suicide. It took a long time for the reality of the moments of holding his hand and pleading with the cops to bring the paramedics faster to be supplanted by an acceptance that it had really, really, actually happened.</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/poetry/the_happy_sun.html">
    The Happy Sun
    - 2014.12.17
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I was raised in a deeply Christian environment. This poem attempts to capture that feeling of awe and later the dissonance as the immaculate truth I held started to crumble.</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/poetry/bedlam.html">
    Bedlam
    - 2017.05.01
    </a>
</h3>
<p>A love story~</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/poetry/we_are_the_same.html">
    We are the same creatures
    - 2018.04.02
    </a>
</h3>
<p>I often find myself deeply proud of the amazing things that humanity is able to accomplish. We are incessantly inventive and are forever striving to create new things—and yet, we have also committed terrible crimes against each other.</p>
