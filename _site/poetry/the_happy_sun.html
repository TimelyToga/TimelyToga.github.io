            <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I was raised in a deeply Christian environment. This poem attempts to capture that feeling of awe and later the dissonance as the immaculate truth I held started to crumble.</p>

<h1>The Happy Sun</h1>
<p class="poetry-date">2014.12.17</p>
<p>The happy sun<br />
rises over<br />
the horizon. <br />
Its happy rays <br />
spread happiness<br />
through all the land.<br />
Without the<br />
happy sun<br />
spreading it<br />
happy rays<br />
throughout all the land,<br />
all the land cannot<br />
feel happiness. <br />
<br />
You know this<br />
because<br />
your mother<br />
told you so. <br />
What better reason<br />
could you ask for?<br />
As far as you<br />
can tell, <br />
your mother<br />
knows everything<br />
and has no faults.<br />
<br />
So you believe <br />
that the happy sun<br />
is the source of all<br />
happiness.<br />
For as long as <br />
you can remember,<br />
everyone that you have<br />
ever met has also <br />
believed that the happy<br />
sun spreading its happy rays<br />
is the only way for all<br />
the lands to feel <br />
happiness. <br />
<br />
Your mother tells<br />
you that some people <br />
don’t believe that the<br />
happy sun is<br />
the source <br />
of all happiness. <br />
<br />
This confuses you,<br />
because the <br />
happy sun is<br />
so very clearly <br />
the source of <br />
all happiness. <br />
<br />
The happy sun<br />
rises every day <br />
and makes all<br />
the lands happy. <br />
That is the cycle.<br />
You know it by heart.<br />
<br />
So the people<br />
who don’t believe<br />
that the happy sun<br />
is the source of all <br />
happiness, they<br />
can’t be happy. <br />
<br />
Since you<br />
like being happy,<br />
it makes sense that<br />
you should tell<br />
them that the <br />
happy sun <br />
really is the source<br />
of all happiness.<br />
<br />
So you do.<br />
<br />
But as you tell<br />
them that the<br />
reason that they<br />
aren’t happy is that<br />
they don’t believe<br />
the happy sun<br />
is the source of<br />
all happiness,<br />
you notice that<br />
they do look<br />
pretty happy. <br />
<br />
That’s odd.<br />
<br />
You think that<br />
you had better<br />
ask your mother<br />
why this is.<br />
<br />
So you do.<br />
<br />
Your mother says<br />
that you are wrong<br />
and you couldn’t have<br />
possibly seen<br />
what you think<br />
you’ve seen,<br />
So you should <br />
stop talking about<br />
things that you <br />
don’t understand<br />
and just have faith.<br />
Faith that the happy sun<br />
is the<br />
source of all happiness.<br />
<br />
Over time you <br />
find more and more<br />
things that seem to <br />
be at odds with the<br />
stories that your mother<br />
has told you,<br />
<br />
The happy sun<br />
was never real.<br />
But somehow <br />
his memory lives<br />
on.</p>
