            <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I often find myself deeply proud of the amazing things that humanity is able to accomplish. We are incessantly inventive and are forever striving to create new things—and yet, we have also committed terrible crimes against each other.</p>

<h1>We are the same creatures</h1>
<p class="poetry-date">2018.04.02</p>
<p>We are the <br />
same creatures <br />
that sealed <br />
men in <br />
metal cans <br />
atop of <br />
chemical bombs<br />
and hung<br />
them above <br />
our atmosphere<br />
so they could <br />
show us <br />
what they saw<br />
<br />
We are the<br />
same creatures <br />
that <br />
cornered <br />
wild horses <br />
on the<br />
desolate<br />
plains of<br />
pre-history <br />
so we <br />
could unite <br />
ourselves<br />
with the <br />
destinations <br />
at the end <br />
of vast distances<br />
<br />
We are the <br />
same creatures <br />
that pulled<br />
back the <br />
curtain on <br />
the dynamics <br />
of the <br />
natural world <br />
<br />
We are the<br />
same creatures <br />
that built <br />
entire societies <br />
upon the <br />
understanding <br />
that because <br />
our high technology<br />
allows us <br />
to walk onto <br />
distant beaches <br />
and leave<br />
the owner <br />
of equals <br />
believed <br />
to be<br />
animals.<br />
<br />
We are the<br />
same creatures <br />
that unleashed<br />
balls of <br />
fire and flame <br />
large enough <br />
to <br />
erase cities <br />
from reality <br />
all over <br />
lines on  <br />
maps<br />
<br />
Our<br />
civilizations <br />
have risen and <br />
fallen with <br />
a comedic <br />
periodicity <br />
as we <br />
strive<br />
to define <br />
the act of <br />
being human.<br />
<br />
Our history<br />
is ferociously <br />
upsetting. <br />
We have <br />
committed acts<br />
too heinous <br />
to fathom <br />
given our <br />
current <br />
paved roads,<br />
movie theatres,<br />
and puppy stores. <br />
<br />
Dare not remove <br />
yourself from <br />
this “We”<br />
as <br />
Countless times <br />
we have proved <br />
to ourselves <br />
that our savagery<br />
is infinite <br />
in its ingenuity<br />
and it can <br />
take as little <br />
as 6 days <br />
for anyone<br />
to transform <br />
into Cruelty<br />
herself. <br />
<br />
We are<br />
a young<br />
species<br />
with many <br />
mistakes yet <br />
to make,<br />
but I am <br />
proud to be <br />
alive and to <br />
know that <br />
<br />
I <br />
am human<br />
<br />
You<br />
are human <br />
<br />
The progress <br />
we have made <br />
points me <br />
only to <br />
the glory <br />
we can <br />
achieve <br />
beyond the present. <br />
<br />
Gather close <br />
with a stranger now <br />
and rejoice<br />
<br />
in all that<br />
we <br />
are in common<br />
and are different<br />
<br />
in all that<br />
we<br />
have overcome <br />
and all the <br />
higher we <br />
will streak<br />
upwards.</p>
