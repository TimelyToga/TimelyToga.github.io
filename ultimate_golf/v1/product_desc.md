# 14/11/17 Meeting


## Product Flow
* One golf hole map with shots
* Zoom out to entire course map with path
* Dialog Good vs. Bad?
  * If yes --> distance range? (Maybe....)
  * Key Variances between good and bad shots
    * What metrics are determining your good vs. bad
    * Display in a graphic / tabular form
* Then individual swing selection / analysis with the avatar
  * Can see stats throughout the swing
  * 6 key points
    * Start, 3, top, 3, contact, 9, finish
    * Display "interesting" stats at each point
      * Can be good or bad
  * Draw attention to the data collection devices
    * Hip, glove, mat
* Do you want to set your targets to the good shots?
  * Planning for the future based on present performance

Might need to abstract a bit to focus on the useful features of the product
instead of digging deep on each feature

Jamie will send another spreadsheet with an updated flow following the progress
on a single hole

## Plans
* Collect Jamie's picture folder for inspiration
* Build the basic elements that are outside of the content
  * We want to keep the content general
  * Then we can expand over time
