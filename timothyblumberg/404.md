# 404
I'm sorry for leading you here. Hopefully this was you trying to type in a link by yourself instead of me changing link URLs.

Broken links are [destroying the web](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/). 

## Now `golang` away
```go
func My404Page() error {
    return errors.New("This was a big mistake...")
}
```
