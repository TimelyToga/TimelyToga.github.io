I'm Timothy Blumberg. At time of writing I'm 25 years old and thrilled about all the cool things that exist on Planet Earth.

## What I do 
I'm an avid learner and programmer.

## Philosophy
I like to think that life is intrinsically meaningless and that the fact that we have found ourselves conscious
is a rather delightful accident. The fun part about being alive is that we alone have the power to define a 
meaning for our conscious existence. I think we should each think long and hard about what sorts of things 
you could do with your moments alive and then chase after them with all possible gusto.

## Hobbies
I have some fun hobbies and I'm looking for more all the time. This list is in order of picking them up:

* Reading Science Fiction
* Watching Lectures on Youtube
* Poker
* Tennis
* Trying to understand investing
